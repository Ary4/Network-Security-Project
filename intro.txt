Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. For eg. Hiding a secret message inside
a piece of art. or another example, using a special invisible ink to write content over an image.
In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.

Now, how can we implement steganography? The answer lies with pixel manupulation, where pixels are accordingly changed wrt encoded message.
In this project, we have taken a simple algorithm called as Least-Significant bit data hiding. 

It uses a 24-bit image where each pixel is made up of 3 8bit values R,G,B values that is to say. By changing the LSB of RGB values to desired 
binary values, the colour of pixel is changing..but very slightly so that human eyes cant even notice the difference.
However, this is too easy to crack by hackers.. So, we also deploying AES encryption and random pixel hiding for better hiding.
 

More details on encryption and decryption algorithm will be explained by:
